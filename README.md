#AI Pipeline
This repository provides a robust AI pipeline for image processing that leverages deep learning models and transformers to segment, identify, and analyze objects within an input image. The pipeline integrates state-of-the-art models to perform image segmentation, object detection, and data extraction. It outputs a detailed summary table mapping each detected object with relevant attributes.
#Features
Image Segmentation: Uses deep learning models to segment different regions within the image.
Object Detection and Classification: Identifies and classifies objects using advanced transformers or deep learning models.
Data Extraction: Extracts and analyzes relevant information from the detected objects.
Summary Table: Generates a summary table with mapped data for each detected object, including unique IDs, descriptions, extracted text, and additional analysis.

In an AI pipeline, summarizing text involves processing and condensing textual data extracted from various sources such as images, documents, or web pages. The goal is to create a brief, coherent summary that captures the key points and essential information.
